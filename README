1. vdr-diff-prep

We (NUBIC) have been called upon to compare two VDR submission[1] files.
Although ncs_mdes_warehouse[2] contains code to compare two warehouse
instances, it is (given the right tools) faster to compare the VDR files
in their most concrete form, i.e. text.

Parts of the VDR file are easy to visually compare: the MDES version and
study center ID, for instance.  However, VDR files can be hundreds of
megabytes in size, and it's the transmission table elements where the
bulk of the data is located.  Diffing this visually is infeasible.

Although VDR submission files are XML, they have a simple, predictable
structure that makes it possible to eliminate hierarchy (indeed, even
any semblance of XML) from that XML file and produce a file that
contains all transmission table data in the VDR XML file, yet is much
more amenable to diffing via e.g. sort(1) and diff(1).

This tool implements that transformation process for transmission table
elements.

2. How to use

    ./vdr-diff-prep VDR_FILE MDES_VERSION | sort > vdr_file.out

Standard input can also be used:

     bzcat huge_vdr.xml.bz2 | ./vdr-diff-prep - 3.2 | sort > vdr_file.out

Finally, if you have two VDR files for MDES 3.2, you want to diff them,
and you have more CPU and I/O bandwidth than time, you might do
something like this:

     parallel --header : './vdr-diff-prep {xml} 3.2 | sort > {xml}.out' \
       ::: xml vdr1.xml vdr2.xml

See [3] for more information about parallel(1).

The output files can then be diffed using your favorite text diffing tool.

3. The output file

The output file looks like this:

    addressSOME_ADDRESS_ID:du_id     12345
    addressSOME_ADDRESS_ID:institute_id      nil
    addressSOME_ADDRESS_ID:person_id nil
    addressSOME_ADDRESS_ID:provider_id       nil
    addressSOME_ADDRESS_ID:psu_id    12345678
    addressSOME_ADDRESS_ID:state     -4

That is, each line is a variable in a transmission table.  Each line has
two columns; columns are separated by a tab.  The first column is a
concatentation of the transmission table name and its keys' values; the
second column is the textual value of the variable (with the exception
that variables with nil value show up as "nil").

This can be sorted (as in the above examples) and then diffed.

4. Caveats

This might not be useful.  We're just trying it out now.  Use at your own risk,
etc.
